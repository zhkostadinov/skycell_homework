Feature: Dynamic Battery Level Threshold in the Cloud Platform

  Background: Company account
    Given I am on login page
    When I navigate to battery page

  Scenario: Enable dynamic battery level threshold configuration
    And I configure battery level threshold settings
    Then the system should allow dynamic configuration of battery level thresholds

  Scenario: Verify dynamic threshold for battery replacement
    And I configure "dynamic" battery level threshold settings
    When location's battery level falls below the "threshold"
    Then the system should trigger a replacement

  Scenario: Ensure one location adjustment of battery level thresholds
    And I configure "dynamic" battery level threshold settings
    When I update the battery level threshold "dynamically"
    Then the new threshold is applied

  Scenario: Handle errors in battery level threshold configuration
    And I configure "dynamic" battery level threshold settings
    When an error occurs during threshold adjustment
    Then I should see an error

  Scenario: Dynamic threshold adjustment feature in multiple locations
    When I configure "dynamic" battery level threshold settings at multiple locations
    Then I should the the new threshold is applied
