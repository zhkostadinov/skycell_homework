Explanation:

This scenario is critical for testing as it covers the end-to-end process of dynamic location selection for battery replacements and the associated LED indication.
It ensures that the cloud platform, IoT service, gateways, and loggers work seamlessly to handle dynamic configurations and provide timely alerts and visual indicators.
It addresses the specific requirements outlined by the customer regarding battery management, optimizing battery life by limiting LED blinking to selected replacement locations.


I can see unavailable loggers could not sending measured data
- what about if they save the data(in message broker, in a queue), and once available, they can load and push that data?
