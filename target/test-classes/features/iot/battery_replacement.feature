Feature: Battery Replacement in Locations

  Background: Company account
    Given I am on login page
    When I navigate to battery page

  Scenario: Verify battery replacement is not needed in most locations
    And I can see there are 1,000 locations
    When I check battery status in each location
    Then I should see not require a battery replacemen in tese locations

  Scenario: Confirm sporadic need for battery replacement
    And I can see there are 1,000 locations
    When I see some locations experience low battery levels
    Then I shoild see those specific locations identified for replacement

  Scenario: Ensure proper functioning after battery replacement
    And I can see a "static.location" requires a battery replacement
    When the battery is replaced
    Then "static.location" should have a functioning battery

  Scenario: Check battery status after multiple replacements
    And I trigger multiple battery replacements at "static.location"
    When the battery status is checked
    Then "static.location" should have a functioning battery

  Scenario: Monitor long-term battery health
    And "static.location" has been in operation for an extended period
    When the battery status is checked
    Then "static.location" should have a functioning battery
